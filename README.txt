The weather service client returns weather forecast data in HTML tabular format.
When both hourly and 10 days is selected, it returns weather forecast for 10 days as shown in the RIT application.
When the user goes back to the form to put city and state information, it is not auto-filling the value. I asked
Dr. Gary whether it needs to be cached or not, he said it is not required.

Thank you!
